. The Dashboard (The Left Side)
​This is where the actual charts live. It’s the final product that a manager would look at to see how the business is doing.
​KPI Cards: The big numbers at the top left ($817.86K) show the "bottom line"—total sales at a glance.
​Line Chart: Shows sales trends over the months. You can see peaks and valleys in revenue throughout the year.
​Pie/Bar Charts: These break down sales by the type of pizza (e.g., The Thai Chicken Pizza vs. The Classic Deluxe).
​Slicer: That list of pizza names in the middle acts like a filter. If you click "The Big Meat Pizza," all the other charts will update to show data only for that pizza.
​2. The Toolset (The Right Side)
​This is the "behind-the-scenes" area used to build the charts.
​Visualizations Pane: That grid of small icons (bar charts, maps, etc.) is where you choose what kind of chart you want to make.
​Fields List: On the far right, you see the "sales data" table. These are the raw ingredients—things like order_date, pizza_name, and total_price. To make a chart, you simply drag one of these names onto the canvas.
